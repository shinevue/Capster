- think carefully about the component
- always try to be as specific as possible
- use a minimalistic approach when developing
- generate a prompt
- then with the prompt create a clickable link: [component name](https://v0.dev/chat?q={prompt})
- make sure prompt is url encoded
- finally create the file and add the component
